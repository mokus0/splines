description:            This is a fairly simple implementation of a 
                        general-purpose spline library, just to get the code
                        out there.  Its interface is still mildly unstable and
                        may change (hopefully not drastically) as new needs or
                        better style ideas come up.  Patches, suggestions
                        and/or feature requests are welcome.
